Similar to [trybuild](https://crates.io/crates/trybuild), but allows you to test how declarative or procedural macros are expanded.

----

## Documentation

Please refer to the documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tryexpand).

## Requirements

`tryexpand` requires [cargo-expand](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-expand) to be installed.

## Usage

### Installation

Add `tryexpand` to your project as a dev-dependency by running

```terminal
cargo install --dev tryexpand
```

### Writing tests

Then under your crate's `tests/` directory, create `tests.rs` file containing calls to `tryexpand::expand()` and populate the `tests/expand/pass/`, `tests/expand/checked_pass/` and `tests/expand/fail/` directories with corresponding Rust source files under test.

#### Pass

The base of each `tryexpand` test suite is the `tryexpand::expand()` function, which you pass a list of file paths (or glob patterns) to:

```rust
#[test]
pub fn pass() {
    tryexpand::expand(
        ["tests/expand/pass/*.rs"]
    ).expect_pass();

    // or its short-hand (by default `.expect_pass()` is implied):

    tryexpand::expand(
        ["tests/expand/pass/*.rs"]
    );
}
```

By default `tryexpand::expand()` assert matched test files to expand successfully.

#### Fail

If instead you want to write tests for macro expansion diagnostics, then will have to add a call to `.expect_fail()`:

```rust
#[test]
pub fn fail() {
    tryexpand::expand(
        ["tests/expand/fail/*.rs"]
    ).expect_fail();
}
```

#### CLI arguments

Additionally you can specify arguments to pass to `cargo expand`:

```rust
#[test]
tryexpand::expand(
    // ...
)
// ...
.args(["--features", "test-feature"])
.expect_pass();
```

#### CLI env vars

as well as environment variables to set for `cargo expand`:

```rust
tryexpand::expand(
    // ...
)
// ...
.envs([("MY_ENV", "my env var value")])
.expect_pass();
```

#### cargo check

You can also make `tryexpand` type-check the expanded code for you (i.e. `cargo check`):

```rust
tryexpand::expand(
    // ...
)
// ...
.and_check()
.expect_pass();
```

#### cargo run

Or you can make `tryexpand` run the expanded code for you (i.e. `cargo run`):

```rust
tryexpand::expand(
    // ...
)
// ...
.and_run()
.expect_pass();
```

#### cargo test

Or you can make `tryexpand` run the expanded code's included unit tests (if there are any) for you (i.e. `cargo test`):

```rust
tryexpand::expand(
    // ...
)
// ...
.and_run_tests()
.expect_pass();
```

### Running tests

The test can be run with:

```terminal
cargo test
```

While it is possible to run parallel tests it is recommended to run them serially:

```terminal
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

For debugging purposes you may want to see the output for all tests, not just the failing ones:

```terminal
cargo test -- --no-capture
```

Each `tryexpand` test will invoke the `cargo expand` command (as well as any of the optional follow-up commands: `cargo check`, `cargo run`, `cargo test`) on each of the source files that matches the glob pattern and will compare the expansion result with the corresponding `*.out.rs`, `*.out.txt` or `*.err.txt` snapshot files.

If the environment variable `TRYEXPAND=overwrite` is provided (e.g. `$ TRYEXPAND=overwrite cargo test`), then snapshot files will be created, or overwritten, if one already exists. Snapshot files should get checked into version control.

Hand-writing snapshot files is not recommended.

### Performance considerations

When working with multiple expansion test files, it is recommended to specify wildcard (`*.rs`) instead of doing a multiple calls to the `expand` functions for individual files.

Usage of wildcards for multiple files will group them under a single temporary crate for which dependencies will be built a single time. In contrast, calling `expand` functions for each source file will create multiple temporary crates and that will reduce performance as dependencies will be build for each of the temporary crates.

[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) on how glob patterns work.

See [tests/macro-tests](tests/macro-tests) and [tests/proc-macro-tests](tests/proc-macro-tests) as a reference.

### Reliability considerations

Since each rustc/cargo release might make changes to the emitted diagnostics
it is recommended to run `tryexpand` tests using a [pinned](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/overrides.html) [toolchain](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html), e.g.:

```terminal
cargo +1.76.0 test <OPTIONS>
```

### Debugging

For each `expand()`-like method call within your tests a temporary and uniquely named Rust project will get generated within `$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/target/tests/`.
By default these projects will get deleted upon test completion (regardless of the outcome).
If you wish to take a look at the actual code/projects being expanded you can provide `TRYEXPAND_KEEP_ARTIFACTS=1` (e.g. `$ TRYEXPAND_KEEP_ARTIFACTS=1 cargo test`) and `tryexpand` will skip the cleanup.
