Similar to [trybuild](https://crates.io/crates/trybuild), but allows you to test how declarative or procedural macros are expanded.

----

## Documentation

Please refer to the documentation on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/tryexpand).

## Requirements

`tryexpand` requires [cargo-expand](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-expand) to be installed.

## Usage

### Installation

Add `tryexpand` to your project as a dev-dependency by running

```terminal
cargo install --dev tryexpand
```

### Writing tests

Then under your crate's `tests/` directory, create `tests.rs` file containing the following code:

```rust
// Use `expand()` or `expand_args()` to assert successful expansion:
#[test]
pub fn pass() {
    tryexpand::expand(
        // One or more glob patterns:
        ["tests/expand_pass/*.rs"]
    );
    // or if you need to pass additional CLI arguments:
    tryexpand::expand_args(
        // One or more glob patterns:
        ["tests/expand_pass/*.rs"],
        // Arguments to pass to `cargo expand` command:
        ["--features", "test-feature"]
    );
}

// Use `expand_fail()` or `expand_args_fail()` to assert unsuccessful expansion:
#[test]
pub fn fail() {
    tryexpand::expand_fail(
        // One or more glob patterns:
        ["tests/expand_fail/*.rs"]
    );
    // or if you need to pass additional CLI arguments:
    tryexpand::expand_args_fail(
        // One or more glob patterns:
        ["tests/expand_fail/*.rs"],
        // Arguments to pass to `cargo expand` command:
        ["--features", "test-feature"]
    );
}
```

Next populate the `tests/expand_pass/` and `tests/expand_fail/` directories with Rust source files.

### Running tests

The test can be run with:

```terminal
cargo test
```

While it is possible to run parallel tests it is recommended to run them serially:

```terminal
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

For debugging purposes you may want to see the output for all tests, not just the failing ones:

```terminal
cargo test -- --no-capture
```

Each `tryexpand` test will invoke the `cargo expand` command on each of the source files that matches the glob pattern and will compare the expansion result with the corresponding `*.expanded.rs` file.

If the environment variable `TRYEXPAND=overwrite` is provided, then `*.expanded.rs` snapshot files will
be created, or overwritten, if one already exists. Snapshot files should get checked into version control.

Hand-writing `*.expanded.rs` files is not recommended.

Possible test outcomes are:

- **Pass**: expansion succeeded and the result is the same as in the `.expanded.rs` file.
- **Failure**: expansion failed, is missing or was different from the existing `.expanded.rs` file content.

### Performance considerations

When working with multiple expansion test files, it is recommended to specify wildcard (`*.rs`) instead of doing a multiple calls to the `expand` functions for individual files.

Usage of wildcards for multiple files will group them under a single temporary crate for which dependencies will be built a single time. In contrast, calling `expand` functions for each source file will create multiple temporary crates and that will reduce performance as dependencies will be build for each of the temporary crates.
